    "\n",
    "📌 Extended Insight:\n",
    "The price gap between the most expensive (Electric) and least expensive (Hybrid) fuel types is minimal — less than $500. This suggests BMW maintains a relatively consistent pricing strategy across fuel types, possibly to avoid large perception gaps in value.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Possible Reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "BMW’s positioning of electric models as premium, tech-forward vehicles with higher R&D costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diesel and petrol models priced closely due to similar performance and luxury positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrids possibly priced slightly lower to attract eco-conscious buyers into BMW’s portfolio without premium deterrents.\n",

    "Opportunity to command a stronger price premium on electric models if unique features (autonomous driving, extended range, luxury interiors) are highlighted more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain competitive pricing for hybrids to capture growing sustainability-focused segments.\n",

    "\n",
    "📌 Extended Insight:\n",
    "The presence of both luxury sedans (7 Series, 5 Series, 3 Series) and SUVs (X1, X3, X5, X6) in the top ranks reflects BMW’s broad appeal to multiple customer segments. Notably, electric and hybrid models such as the i8 and i3 are also among the top performers, indicating a growing acceptance of alternative fuel technologies in BMW’s lineup.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Possible Reason:\n",
    "\n",

    "The top-selling regions likely include North America, Europe, and Asia, driven by strong brand recognition, established dealer networks, and higher disposable incomes. Lower sales regions (e.g., Africa, Middle East, South America) may be underrepresented due to smaller luxury market segments or logistical challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Possible Reason:\n",
