    "### **Key Insights and Analysis Highlights**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.Pricing Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Electric BMWs Lead the Price Race, Hybrids Keep It Budget-Friendly.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pricing analysis reveals that Electric BMWs command the highest average price at approximately $75,276, followed closely by Diesel ($75,080) and Petrol ($74,990) models, Hybrids having the lowest average price ($74,798). This suggests that while the pricing gap between fuel types is relatively narrow, electric vehicles maintain a slight premium, likely due to their advanced technology, lower running costs, and market positioning as a luxury, eco-friendly option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 Possible Reason:**\n",
    "\n",
    "BMW’s positioning of electric models as premium, tech-forward vehicles with higher R&D costs. Diesel and petrol models priced closely due to similar performance and luxury positioning. Hybrids possibly priced slightly lower to attract eco-conscious buyers into BMW’s portfolio without premium deterrents\n",
    "\n",
    "**💼 Business Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric BMWs presents an opportunity to position them as flagship luxury models, reinforcing their eco-friendly and high-tech image. Meanwhile, the lower pricing of hybrids can be leveraged as a strategic entry point to attract price-sensitive customers and expand market share in the mid-luxury segment. Since pricing variation is minimal, differentiation should come from features, performance, and ownership benefits rather than just cost.\n",

    "### **2. Demand & Popularity Trends**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Everyday heroes win the sales race-7 series**\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 7 Series is the top-selling BMW model with a 9.39% share of total sales, closely followed by the i8 (9.24%) and X1 (9.24%). Demand is well-distributed across the top 10 models, each holding around 9% share.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of both luxury sedans (7 Series, 5 Series, 3 Series) and SUVs (X1, X3, X5, X6) in the top ranks reflects BMW’s broad appeal to multiple customer segments. Notably, electric and hybrid models such as the i8 and i3 are also among the top performers, indicating a growing acceptance of alternative fuel technologies in BMW’s lineup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 Possible Reason:**\n",
    "\n",
    "BMW’s marketing strategy promotes both premium luxury and performance-oriented SUVs. Electric/hybrid adoption is boosted by government incentives and increasing environmental awareness. Balanced portfolio strategy ensures no single model overshadows the rest, maintaining brand diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**💼 Business Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain balanced production across top models to avoid stockouts in high-demand variants.Increase investment in EV and hybrid R&D, as their demand is now comparable to traditional fuel models.Leverage the diverse product mix in marketing to target different buyer personas — luxury seekers, family SUV buyers, and eco-conscious consumers.\n",

    "**Strong in the West, opportunities in the East.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales are not evenly distributed — certain regions contribute significantly more BMW sales than others, with clear leaders in the dataset.The top-selling regions likely include North America, Europe, and Asia, driven by strong brand recognition, established dealer networks, and higher disposable incomes. Lower sales regions (e.g., Africa, Middle East, South America) may be underrepresented due to smaller luxury market segments or logistical challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 Possible Reason:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic prosperity and purchasing power concentrated in top regions. Stronger marketing, financing options, and model availability in developed markets. Regional preferences — e.g., SUVs in North America, sedans in Europe, compact luxury in Asia.\n",
    "\n",
    "**💼 Business Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus inventory and marketing spend in top-performing regions to maximize Return on Investment.Explore growth strategies in lower-performing regions — targeted promotions, localized marketing, or entry-level models to boost penetration.Use high-sales regions as test beds for new model launches before rolling out globally.\n",

    "### **4. Resale Value & Depreciation Curves**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Luxury fades slowly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a noticeable negative correlation between Mileage (km) and Price (USD), indicating that as the mileage of a vehicle increases, its price tends to decrease. Scatter plots segmented by car Model show that while the overall trend is depreciation with increasing mileage, different models exhibit distinct depreciation slopes. Some models retain value better over mileage, suggesting brand or model-specific resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 Possible Reason**\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher mileage typically indicates more wear and tear, which lowers market value. Additionally, some models are perceived as more durable or desirable, affecting their price depreciation rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**💼 Business Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding model-specific depreciation patterns can help dealerships and resellers optimize pricing strategies, forecast resale values more accurately, and tailor marketing efforts based on expected vehicle longevity.\n",

    "Average prices for all fuel types are closely aligned, with Electric BMWs leading slightly ($75,276 mean) and Hybrids having the lowest average ($74,798). The median prices follow the same trend, and the price range ($30K–$120K) is nearly identical across all categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌Possible Reason:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers may result from limited editions, special features, or exceptionally maintained vehicles. Electric vehicles often come with advanced technology, and Diesel models span from economy to luxury, causing price variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**💼Business Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since pricing differences between fuel types are minimal, BMW can focus on value-based marketing—emphasizing technology, performance, and eco-benefits—rather than relying solely on price as a differentiator.

Electric and Hybrid vehicles show relatively higher prices at comparable mileage levels compared to Diesel and Petrol, suggesting better mileage efficiency or perceived value retention.\n",
